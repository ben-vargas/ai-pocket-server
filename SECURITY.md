Security Policy
===============

Reporting a vulnerability
-------------------------

Please report security issues privately via email:

  yayasoumah@gmail.com

Do not create a public issue for vulnerabilities. Include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Affected version/commit (if known)
- Impact assessment (what an attacker can do)
- Any suggested mitigations

Disclosure & timelines
----------------------

- I will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and investigate.
- No formal SLA is promised, but I aim to provide status updates while working on a fix.
- Once a fix is available, details may be published with credit to the reporter (optional).

Scope
-----

This policy covers the `pocket-server` repository. For other related projects, please open a discussion in their respective repositories.
